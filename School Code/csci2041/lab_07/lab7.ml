(* Tests. The first few tests make sure C works for base cases and one or two
simple cases. All these tests should have VERY small execution times. Times
for your code MAY BE DIFFERENT. *)

(* These tests make sure MEMY C works for base cases and simple cases too. They
should also have very small execution times, but maybe a little larger than
those of C. It's because MEMY C does work to maintain its hash table. Times
for your code MAY BE DIFFERENT. *)
